0.86
        Upgrade database schema to version 11 (text columns no longer have a
          default value, for compatibility with MySQL strict mode).
        Remove code for dealing with upgrades to database schema version 10
	  (which came in over a decade ago).

0.85    16 December 2016
        Make ->rename_node try to ensure a valid new node name (depending on
          formatter parameters).
        Add dependency on CGI which is no longer core (RT#118582)

0.84    23 February 2014
        Add new options to Lucy and Plucene backends: (1) content munging
          before search indexing, (2) total exclusion of certain nodes from
          search indexing.

0.83    22 November 2013
        Fix bug in Lucy backend (if you wrote a node Foo Bar and then one
          called Foo, it would delete Foo Bar from its index).
        Make Lucy backend capable of indexing metadata as well.
        Allow weighting of node title in Lucy search.

0.82    12 October 2013
        Fix uninitialised value warnings in Lucy backend

0.81    25 May 2013
        Fix compatibility with DBD::SQLite 1.83+ (RT#84680)
        Added a backend for searching with Lucy - Wiki::Toolkit::Search::Lucy
        Fix POD errors which are fatal with perl 5.18.

0.80    3 May 2012
        Spelling fix in Wiki::Toolkit::Search::Base
        Fixed deprecated use of foreach ... qw (fixes #53 and #54)
        Fixed bug with metadata_was in recent changes (#41).

0.79    14 August 2010
        Fix Win32 test failure http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/8099980
        Declare minimum required Perl version
        (thanks to Alexandr Ciornii for the patches)

0.78    16 December 2009
        Fix various POD errors and add POD testing (#45)
        More recent changes tests (for #41)
        Fix transaction handling in SQLite backend (#49)

0.77    24 December 2008
        Complete support for store->list_metadata_by_type, which
          returns a list of all the metadata values
        Add store->list_metadata_names, which will tell you all the
          different metadata types (names)
        write_node: return the version of the node that was just committed,
        if successful
        Don't write out a new version of a node if the checksum is the
        same as the one already stored (#43)
        t/400_upgrade.t: skip all tests correctly if no backends
        configured (#44)
        Configure charset correctly when passing in an existing $dbh (#24)

0.76    13 July 2008
        Really add missing prereq of DBI!
        Add testing of database schema upgrades (#32)
        Move to new schema version 10, including some missing indexes
          and support for verified flags. Note that
          the code using this column has not yet been written (#25, #34).
        Changed Wiki::Toolkit::Feed::Listing to use metadata_was instead of
          metadata_wasnt, for efficiency reasons.
        list_dangling_links, list_backlinks: don't return internal links
          that are from a node which does not exist. This works around
          database inconsistencies (introduced by manual deletion of nodes)
          which should be fixed by adding constraints to the database (see #38)

0.75	11 May 2008
        Added support for selecting versions by moderation status (see
          OpenGuides ticket #142).
        Added "new_only" parameter to ->list_recent_changes, so you can ask
          for e.g. all pages added in the last week.  This involved a bit of
          a rewrite of ->list_recent_changes, so please keep an eye out for
          any bugs that may have been introduced (I'm not convinced the test
          suite covered everything it should have).
        Fix some badly-formatted POD documentation which accidentally included
          some code
        Fix uninitialized warnings in feed tests
        Fix database setup to ignore tables that aren't Wiki::Toolkit tables
        Fix test suite's incorrect passing of DBIxFTSMySQL connection
          parameters
        Add missing prereq of DBI (caught by the CPAN testers) and don't
          use DBI in Makefile.PL
        Add new scripts wiki-toolkit-delete-node and
          wiki-toolkit-revert-to-date

0.74    9  June 2007
        Added list_last_version_before method, to get the version of all the
         nodes at a given point in time
        Updated version on Text::WikiFormat dependency to avoid long-standing
         test failure with old version
        Bump version number of Wiki::Toolkit::Plugin as this was not done
         the last time it was changed (for CPAN.pm compatibility)

0.73    12 December 2006
        Added parse_feed_timestamp method
        Added encoding parameter to the Feed methods, to allow overriding
          the store's encoding.

0.72    15 September 2006
        Install wiki-toolkit-rename-node

0.71    30 August 2006
        More feed code refactoring, to allow "mini" feeds with just
          name, and optionally distance and location. Typically used in
          search results, especially with Wiki::Toolkit::Plugin::Locator's
        Ability to filter by nodes without certain metadata, by type
          or type+value ("everything without a longitude" or 
          "everything not category=Pub")
        Fix bug in Listing.pm pod output

0.70    6 June 2006
        Feed code has been refactored.
        Check that the database schema is up-to-date when initializing the
          store and abort otherwise.
        In PostgresSQL setup code, delete orphaned content/metadata rows.
        When we bulk delete and insert data for an upgrade, check to make
          sure we can create the tables and indexes before dropping the old
          tables.
        Other miscellaneous fixes.

0.69_03 13 May 2006
        Add Wiki::Toolkit::Feed::RSS (formerly CGI::Wiki::Plugin::RSS::Modwiki)
          and Wiki::Toolkit::Feed::Atom (formerly CGI::Wiki::Plugin::Atom)

0.69_02 27 April 2006
        Add missing new file lib/Wiki/Toolkit/Setup/Database.pm to
          distribution.

0.69_01 23 April 2006
        *** IMPORTANT NOTICE *** This release introduces a new database schema
        which should be considered beta in nature at this stage. It is not yet
        suitable for deployment on production data and should only be tested
        on copies of your production data. If it eats your data, you get to
        keep the pieces. Additionally, functionality exposed in this beta
        release is subject to change.

        Rename to Wiki::Toolkit.
        Support for moderation on a per-node basis.
        Update to the database schema: added needs_moderation column to
         node, and moderated column to content
        You will need to run wiki-toolkit-setupdb to upgrade your database

		Many more plugin points: pre_write + pre_retrieve (get to change
		 the data), pre_moderate + post_moderate, pre_rename + post_rename,
		 + post_delete. See test 150 for examples, and the perldoc of
		 Wiki::Toolkit::Plugin for a description.

        Merge Wiki::Toolkit::Formatter::Multiple:
        0.02    15 September 2004
                Applied patch from Tom Insam to fix bug with 
                find_internal_links.

        0.01    22 September 2003
                Initial release.

0.69    22 February 2006
        Update to database schema: added an ID column to node, and changed
          the content + metadata tables to FK to the ID field, rather than
          the node name. Also added rails like schema_info table, to hold
          the current database schema version number
        You will need to run cgi-wiki-setupdb to upgrade your database

0.62    26 November 2004
        Fixed delete_node bug - now it's OK to delete eg version 2 and
          then version 3 of a node (ie you no longer have to delete
          versions in order newest first).

0.61    3 October 2004
        Added "ignore_case" option to ->node_exists.

0.60    30 September 2004
        Added generic ->new method to CGI::Wiki::Plugin (Tom Insam).

0.59    18 September 2004
        Added "ignore_case" option to list_recent_changes for use with
          metadata filtering.

0.58    18 September 2004
        Even more powerful metadata filtering!  You can now supply both
          "metadata_was" and "metadata_wasnt", or both "metadata_is"
          and "metadata_isnt", and they will be ANDed.
        (Also added the test I forgot to add to MANIFEST last time.)

0.57    18 September 2004
        Extended capabilities of list_recent_changes - more powerful
          metadata filtering (see docs for details).

0.56    14 September 2004
        Added Plucene search backend (with help from Simon Cozens).
        Applied Tom Insam's encoding patch.

0.55    There wasn't one.  Something bizarre happened with PAUSE.

0.54    25 June 2004
        Let ->delete_node take an optional version parameter.

0.53    18 June 2004
        Fixed CGI::Wiki::TestLib so $iterator->number actually does something.

0.52    10 June 2004
        Add include_all_changes and between_days to list_recent_changes.

0.51    8 June 2004
        Time for a non-developer release.

0.51_02 6 June 2004
        Added support for passing in a database handle instead of
          connection parameters (Chris Winters).

0.51_01 24 February 2004
        Refactoring of search classes in preparation for new search
          backend.  (Simon Cozens)
        Please test against your applications and let me know of any
          problems ASAP.

0.50    21 December 2003
        First non-developer release with new test system.

0.50_02 21 November 2003
        Make tests skip rather than try to run zero tests if no backends
          configured - thanks to nothingmuch via CPAN testers for the
          test failure report.

0.50_01 18 November 2003
        Huge overhaul of test suite, no change in functionality.
        Removed dependency on Test::MockObject and Hook::LexWrap
          (the relevant tests are now skipped if these aren't installed).
        Removed the examples since they were very out of date.
        Made a small clarification to the CGI::Wiki::Plugin docs.

0.49    23 September 2003
        Added "ignore_case" option to ->list_nodes_by_metadata

0.48    22 September 2003
        Couple of small changes so I can write formatters that allow node
          metadata to affect the rendering of the node.
        A rewrite and renaming of the CGI::Wiki distribution is on the
          cards - subscribe to cgi-wiki-dev if you're interested:
          http://www.earth.li/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/cgi-wiki-dev

0.47    29 August 2003
        Added metadata_was and metadata_wasnt parameters to list_recent_changes

0.46    14 August 2003
        Fix for Shevek.  ->write_node used to croak if it failed to index
          the backlinks, but since the MySQL varchar type is case-insensitive
          by default, we were getting a duplicate key error.  As a temporary
          fix pending a proper think about an explicit way for you to specify
          whether you want your wiki case-sensitive or not (yes, people have
          asked me for both), this now just warns if it has trouble writing
          backlinks.

0.45    11 August 2003
        Removed dependency on Class::Delegation.
        Fixed Makefile.PL to check for Lingua::Stem before trying to test
          DBIx::FullTextSearch stuff.
        Fixed DBIx and Search::InvertedIndex tests to take note of database
          host if one supplied.

0.44    10 July 2003
        Fixed bug with metadata_isnt - it wasn't picking up nodes where
          that metadata type wasn't set.

0.43    10 July 2003
        Added metadata_isnt constraint to ->list_recent_changes.

0.42    16 June 2003
        Dropped Test::Warn from the dependencies - it's too much installing
          for too little gain (I was hardly using it).
        Made CGI::Wiki::TestConfig::Utilities check for the Postgres
          Search::InvertedIndex backend, and test using that if possible.

0.41    27 May 2003
        Changed the order of things when registering a plugin, so the
          on_register method can access the datastore properly.

0.40    24 May 2003
        Added an index to the metadata table in the MySQL setup, to
          speed up RecentChanges.  To apply this index to an existing
          database you need to do (as the database superuser):

          CREATE INDEX metadata_index ON metadata
                       (node, version, metadata_type, metadata_value(10))

        Also made the warnings in Makefile.PL and INSTALL stronger, since
          we had another data-eating incident.

0.39    21 May 2003
        Amended Makefile.PL and INSTALL to make it absolutely clear that you
          should not run the tests on databases containing valuable data.
          Thanks to Rocco for, er, stress-testing this, and sorry to 'know'
          for eating its brains...

0.38    17 May 2003
        Added ->list_dangling_links method; thanks to Simon Cozens for
          the idea.

0.37    12 May 2003
        Oh dear.  No real changes, but I moved Extending.pod to stop it
          getting installed as CGI::Extending.  Sorry.

0.36    9 May 2003
        Added CGI::Wiki::Plugin as a base class for plugins to inherit from.

0.35    5 May 2003
        Fixed bug in CGI::Wiki::Store::SQLite introduced with new calling
          syntax in version shipped with 0.34.
        Very basic start at plugin support as described in Extending.pod -
          see 'perldoc CGI::Wiki' for details.

0.34    5 May 2003
        Moving towards adding proper plugin support - the proposed API is
          in Extending.pod, please take a look and send comments.
        In preparation for the above, the metadata hash passed to ->write_node
          can now contain more complex data structures - but these will *not*
          be stored directly, just checksummed.  The way to access them will
          be via plugins.  See 'perldoc CGI::Wiki;' for details.
        Also added alternative calling syntax for the CGI::Wiki::Setup::*
          store modules, as requested by Podmaster.

0.33    3 May 2003
        Added ->fuzzy_title_match method to the Search::InvertedIndex backend
          (CGI::Wiki::Search::SII).  You will need to re-index all existing
          nodes in your wiki in order to take advantage of this.  Take your
          wiki offline and do something like

          my $wiki = CGI::Wiki->new( %conf );
          # (Where %conf is exactly as you would set this up for your actual
          #  Wiki application, including your store, search and formatter
          #  options exactly as you use them live.)
          my @nodes = $wiki->list_all_nodes;
          foreach my $node ( @nodes ) {
            my %node_data = $wiki->retrieve_node( $node );
            $wiki->write_node( $node,
                               $node_data{content}, 
                               $node_data{checksum},
                               $node_data{metadata}
            );
            print "Reindexed $node\n";
          }

        to refresh all the nodes in your database.  Note that for wikis
        of more than a couple of nodes, this can take quite some time.

0.32    2 May 2003
        Fixed bug with write_node dying when using Search::InvertedIndex
          and writing node with blank content (thanks to Bob Walker for
          the bug report).

0.31    26 April 2003
        Added an index to the metadata table in the postgres setup, to
          speed up RecentChanges.  To apply this index to an existing
          database you need to do (as the database superuser):

          bench=# create index metadata_nodeindex on metadata
                   (node, version, metadata_type, metadata_value);

        It will also help speed things up if you run:

          bench=# analyze;

        every so often, maybe once a week.

0.30    22 April 2003
        Added support for supplying 'host' parameter when connecting to
          MySQL/Postgres databases (requested and assisted by Paul Makepeace).

0.29    20 April 2003
        Got rid of the separate bin/user-setup-* scripts, added
          bin/cgi-wiki-setupdb and made it be installed when the rest of
          the distribution is.

0.28    6 April 2003
        Added ->formatter accessor to Wiki.pm

0.27    5 April 2003
        Added ->reinitialise_stores method to CGI::Wiki::TestConfig::Utilities
          to make it easier for plugins and so forth to make sure they have
          nice virginal test stores before they start running their tests.
          Altered my setup tests to use this.

0.26    3 April 2003
        Cleanup:
          - Removed deprecated method retrieve_node_and_checksum.
          - Added DBI as a prerequisite (ta Max).
          - Fixed up the SEE ALSO in the pod.

        Bugfix:
          - The SQLite backend was failing tests with DBI 1.34 or up;
            fixed now (with a kluge, but no worse than the one already there)
            Thanks to DH for the test failure report.

0.25    29 March 2003
        list_recent_changes can now filter on a single metadata criterion
          - multiple criteria coming soon.

0.24    29 March 2003
        list_recent_changes now returns any metadata attached to the node
          as well - so you can put comments and usernames and things in there
          and display them on RecentChanges.  Note that it no longer pretends
          to return a comment separately since you can do it this way now.
          See perldoc CGI::Wiki::Store::Database for the new API.
        Moved recent changes tests out into their own file.

0.23    17 March 2003
        Fixed bug - metadata wasn't getting deleted when ->delete_node
          was called.

0.22    8 March 2003
        Rejig of the way the tests work, in preparation for allowing
          third-party plugins:

            When 'perl Makefile.PL' is run on a CGI::Wiki distribution,
            information will be gathered about test databases etc that
            can be used for running tests. CGI::Wiki::TestConfig::Utilities
            gives you convenient access to this information, so you can
            easily write and run tests for your own CGI::Wiki plugins.

        No functionality changes.

0.21    6 March 2003
        Purely a documentation update; thanks to Alex McLintock for comments.

0.20    22 February 2003
        Added simple (and intentionally naive) metadata support.  Note that
          the database schema has changed (additional 'metadata' table), so
          you will need to re-run the relevant database setup script again as
          described below for upgrading to 0.15.
        Much of this release was written on David Woolger's laptop; thanks :)

0.16    5 February 2003
        Changed CGI::Wiki::Setup::Pg to use the 'timestamp' data type
          instead of 'datetime', since 'datetime' was deprecated and
          has been removed in Postgres 7.3.
        Fixed bug with supplying blank database username/password;
          thanks to DH for the bug report.
        Fixed mistake in pod, pointed out by Podmaster.

0.15    5 January 2003
        Amended store setup modules so their 'setup' functions don't
          wipe pre-existing data; added 'cleardb' functions for when you
          really do want to wipe it.
        Along with that, amended the setup scripts in ./bin/ to take a
          --force-preclear option.  Now they leave existing data by default.
        Added standalone tests for CGI::Wiki::Formatter::Default
        Added $formatter->find_internal_links method and tests.

        Implemented backlinks!  Thanks to blair christensen for the idea,
          and sorry for taking so long to get around to it.

        *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
        *After* upgrading, you will need to re-run the relevant database setup
        script (in ./bin/) on any databases created using earlier versions of
        CGI::Wiki, in order that the internal_links table gets created.  From
        version 0.15, these scripts won't affect data in existing tables, as
        long as you don't supply the --force-preclear option, so this is safe.

 ===>    *** IF YOU DON'T DO THIS THEN YOUR CODE WILL FALL OVER AND DIE. ***

        You have been warned.

        (You can do the database munging before you install this new version
        -- the old versions won't mind the extra table -- but
 ===>                     *** MAKE SURE ***
        to invoke the scripts as something like
          perl -Ilib bin/user-setup-[...]
        so you get the *new* setup modules which *won't* hose your data
        (the old ones did, ugh).)

        The backlink data will also not exist for links *from* a given node
        until you re-write that node.  Take your wiki offline then do
        something like

          my $wiki = CGI::Wiki->new( %conf );
          # (Where %conf is exactly as you would set this up for your actual
          #  Wiki application, including your store, search and formatter
          #  options exactly as you use them live.)
          my @nodes = $wiki->list_all_nodes;
          foreach my $node ( @nodes ) {
            my %nodedata = $wiki->retrieve_node( $node );
            $wiki->write_node($node, $nodedata{content}, $nodedata{checksum});
          }

        to refresh all the nodes in your database.

0.14    3 January 2003
        Added $store->node_exists method and tests.
        Amended $store->list_recent_changes to take a 'last_n_changes'
          parameter, so you can find the last 10 (or whatever) nodes edited.
        Made an internal change to the way ->format is delegated to the
          formatter object, to give said object access to the store.

0.13    2 January 2003
        Minor fix - t/031_formatting.t was being reported as failing on
          systems without support for any of the backends, since I forgot to
          update the SKIP condition when I added six extra tests.  Thanks
          to root@ostend.org for the report via cpan-testers.

0.12    1 January 2003
        The Search::InvertedIndex backend wasn't indexing the node titles -
          fixed and added tests.
        Added tests for non-MySQL Search::InvertedIndex backends and fixed
          CGI::Wiki::Search::SII to be case-insensitive all the time (instead
          of just when using MySQL).
        Tweaked the documentation some more - offers to simplify the docs
          and/or write a tutorial would be greatly appreciated.

0.11    31 December 2002
        Changes suggested by blair christensen, to allow alternate formatters.
        See the README for details and CGI::Wiki::Formatter::Default for an
          example.
        Took out some leftover debug stuff from CGI::Wiki::Search::SII.

0.10    19 December 2002
        Added a Search::InvertedIndex backend; currently only tested with
          the MySQL version of Search::InvertedIndex.  When running make test,
          if the Search::InvertedIndex tests are being run, the following tests
          will warn 'testdb is not open. Can't lock.' (but should pass):
            005_setup_mysql_search_invertedindex.t
            011_cgi_wiki.t

        *** NOTE INTERFACE CHANGE ****
        Cleaned up the initialisation of the Wiki object, at the expense of
          a small interface change - you now need to create your store and
          (optional) search objects yourself and pass them as arguments
          to CGI::Wiki->new - read 'perldoc CGI::Wiki' (once installed)
          for details, or see examples/wiki.cgi in the tarball.

        I'd uploaded an unfinished version by mistake.  One day I will figure
          out how to do this upload thing without screwing up.

0.04    17 November 2002
        Added a DBD::SQLite storage backend (thanks to blair christensen
          for a patch that makes up part of this).
        Added tests and docs for retrieval of old versions of pages
          (bad Kake, should have written those before implementing the
           feature; blair and Richard shamed me into getting it sorted now).
        retrieve_node_and_checksum is now deprecated -- retrieve_node is
          more clever and will return content only or a hash with content
          plus meta-data, according to context.  So you should get at the
          checksum via that.
        user-setup-postgres.pl was buggy, fixed now.
        Only two beer rewards now remain.

0.03    9 November 2002
        Forgot to regenerate and add the README (I've put it in the
        MANIFEST now to stop that happening again).  Also forgot to
        mention that I've upped the bribe.

0.02    9 November 2002
        Pulled out the database setup stuff into modules (Mark Fowler
          did most of this bit, thanks).
        Added recent_changes method and its tests, changed the example
          wiki to show how this can be used.
        Renamed some tests since the order they're run in matters now.
        Added better support for noninteractive installation (with help
          from Mark again).

0.01    28 October 2002
        Initial release.
